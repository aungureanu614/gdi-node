# GirlDevelopIt - Introduction to Node

## Development
Install Node and NVM.

Run `node -v` to confirm you have a stable version of Node. Any even number version - i.e. 0, 2, 4, 6 – will work for the purposes of this project.

Run `node server.js` and check in your terminal to verify that there is a logged output to confirm that your Node is running properly.

## Solutions
The file directory is mirrored, with all solutions included, inside the `gdi-node/solutions/` directory.
