# GirlDevelopIt - Introduction to Node

## Development
Install Node and NVM.
Run `node -v` to confirm you have a stable version of Node (any even number version - i.e. 0, 2, 4, 6 – will work for the purposes of this project).
Run `node server.js` to confirm the server is running.

## Solutions
The file directory is mirrored, with all solutions included, inside the `gdi-node/solutions/` directory.
